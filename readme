This is a repository of project of deep graph explainer.
The source code files and datasets for "DGX: Uncovering general behavior of deep graph models with model-level explanation" will be updated soon.

## Code  
- `problems/`: The problem of evolutionary algorithms designed for model-level graph explanation
- `soea_SEGA.py`: The proposed evolutionary algorithm `DGX` for model-level graph explaination. 
- `main_multi.py`: Main script for model-level explaining experiment.
